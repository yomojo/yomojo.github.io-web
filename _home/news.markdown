#### FAB Skincare

Is now cheaper and comes in larger sizes. A deodorant has been added to the range with a subtle sandalwood scent, and it comes in a beautiful small glass jar.

I have been using FAB for washing, moisturising, deodorising, shaving, getting rid of a cracked skin on my heelâ€¦ They just work.

FAB is a range of skincare that is made with plantbased ingredients and tested on humans only.
