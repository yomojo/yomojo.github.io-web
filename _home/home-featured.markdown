The beautiful woody rich scent of cedarwood—together with Jojoba oil, Seabuckthorn, Vitamin E makes for an impressive beard and hair oil. It’s non greasy, concentrated—you only need to use a small amount, and made from completely natural plant-based ingredients.

You can shave with it too! I've been using it for the last few months and love it.
