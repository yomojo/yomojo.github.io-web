**Plastic is everywhere**

Do you use small bins around the house for non food items, that are dryâ€”sometimes damp? Are the bins lined with plastic bag? How would you like to change that and use something that looks beautiful, has no plastic, has an inner liner that is washable and reusable?

**Introducing the new eco sac bin**

A multi-use eco sac, made from plants that you can use as a bin with a washable liner made from 100% cotton?

The liner is made from Calico. A plain-woven textile, made from half-processed and unbleached cotton fibres. Calico is un-dyed and raw. 100% cotton thread is used throughout. Handmade by me in the UK.
