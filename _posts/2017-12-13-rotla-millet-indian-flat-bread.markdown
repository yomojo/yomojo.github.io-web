Rotla is easy to make and difficult  at the same time. It only requires two ingredients; millet flour and water. To make good rotla is hard and will take lots of practice. I'm not as good as my mum. Many of my mum's friends will ask her to make them—that's how good she is.

### Ingredients

* Millet flour (you can buy this from most Indian groceries)

* Water

### Method

1. Pre-heat a heavy flat pan on a medium heat.

2. Add some millet flour to a high sided dish

3. Add a small amount of water and start to mix with your hands. Keep adding a small amount of water and mixing, until you form a sticky mixture. Keep a small bowl of warm water nearby.

4. make this into a ball (about the size of a tennis ball).

5. Begin to flat the ball between the palm of your hands—see video.

6. Place the uncooked bread onto the flat pan and let it cook for a couple of minutes, and then turn it over. Use a flat wooden spatula to do this. Cook the other side for about the same amount of time. You might need to press on the top to ensure even cooking of the bread.

The great thing with making rotla is that you can make one or many. Just mix another batch to make more and repeat the above process.

Rotla goes well with so many curries but it's just as nice on it's own, especially when it's warm. You could also  have it for breakfast.
