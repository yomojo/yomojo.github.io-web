I love this dish because it's comfort food that you can make any day of the week. You can eat it on it's own, with some salad, pita bread or rice. It's versatile and very easy to make.

If you have a pressure cooker, you can cook everything at once. Otherwise you'll have to pre-cook the beans first.

### Ingredients

*   2 cups of blackeye beans soaked overnight

*   1 cup of fresh beans chopped into small pieces or chopped spinach (optional)

*   Handful fresh tomatoes—tinned is fine

*   1/2 tsp turmeric

*   1 tsp  ground coriander/cumin mix

*   1/4 to 1/2 tsp cayenne (optional)

*   Salt to taste

*   Extra water

### Method

1.  Blend the tomatoes until you have a sauce like consistency.

2.  Add turmeric, coriander/cumin mix, cayenne and mix

3.  Add everything into the pressure cooker and mix. You will need to add some extra water—to cook the beans and create the sauce. Cook until it either whistles once or rises to the the first bar—this depends on your pressure cooker.

4.  Let the pressure decrease before you open the lid and transfer to another large pan if you wish.

5.  If you don't have a pressure cooker—first pre-cook the beans in plenty of water until they are semi cooked.

6.  Drain and rinse the beans.

7.  Add everything to a large pan, including the extra water—mix and cook until the beans are tender.

If there is not enough sauce—add some extra water and cook for a little longer.

You can make this dish in advance, and reheat it when you are ready to eat. Enjoy!
