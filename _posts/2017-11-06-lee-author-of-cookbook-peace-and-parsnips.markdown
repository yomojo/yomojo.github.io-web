excerpt: Lee describes himself as; the mightiest nose-to-tail carnivore of them all,

  nut cutlets in his cookbook, Peace & Parsnips.

### How long have you been eating plant based foods and what made you get into plant foods?
I've been into plants for years, a veggie, now vegan, and I've always worked in the restaurant industry and loved great food.  Vegan cooking is creative and inspiring in so many ways.  I'm vegan because I like animals, the earth, my health and awesome food!

### Do you like making food and what are your favourite foods?
I do like making food.  My favourite foods are fresh, seasonal vegetables and fruits.  Organic, if I'm very lucky.  I love creating new recipes with seasonal produce.

### Describe your day with plant foods.
I normally have a smoothie or a nice bowl of fruit and cereal for brekkie, then a light lunch, mainly salad based, and then dinner time, anything goes.  I'm not a normal chef, as I love cooking at home!!  I cook a fresh meal every night and love travelling, so I bring that inspiration back into my little kitchen in Snowdonia.

### What's your favourite kitchen tool/gadget?
A french peeler.  Genius design and essential.  A sharp knife.  A good blender is awesome.  Can I have three please?

### What one food could you not live without and which food do you miss the most since switching to plant based foods?
I could not live without, or would not be quite as joyful about eating, if curry disappeared from the universe for good.  I don't miss any food since switching to full plant power.  There are so many options out there now for things like cheese and even that fake meat stuff.  Which is bizarre, but many people dig.

### What do you consider the most important foods in your diet and why?
Healthy whole foods.  A balanced vegan diet is the healthiest way to eat; plenty of fruit/ veggies, whole grains, nuts, legumes, dried fruit, GREENS......most of us know the score.  Eat these things and enjoy amazing health and vitality!!  It's a superhuman diet!  But I think one of the most important things is a healthy relationship with food, enjoy eating!!

### Would you say your look and feel more healthy?
Probably.  Although I ate pretty healthy before.

### How has eating plant foods changed you?
I think its made me more aware of what I eat and how I shop/ live in general.  It's a knock on effect of being more conscious of how my actions effect the world and how it effects and influences me.

### What advice would you give to someone who is thinking about getting into plant based foods?
Congratulations.!!  It's the best thing you could ever do!!  Go for it!!!
