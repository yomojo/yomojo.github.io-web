Chickpeas again! They just are so versatile and inexpensive. You can make this tortilla below to feed eight people easily. The ingredients list below should not cost more than £4.00—that's cheap for eight people!

You will need an oven proof pan that can also be used on the hob. This is a two part cooking process but you'll be rewarded with a delicious meal at the end.

Keeps for 2 to 3 days in the fridge.
