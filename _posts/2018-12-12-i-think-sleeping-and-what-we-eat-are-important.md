Three books that we should all read.

**Why We Sleep**: [The new science of sleep](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-We-Sleep-Science-Dreams-ebook/dp/B06Y649387/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1512589383&sr=1-1&keywords=why+we+sleep) Mathew Walker says that sleep is not an option but necessary. He explains in easy terms the science behind sleep. Over 60 years of reserach are in this book. He says, _"Sleep is non-negotiable."_ A few more quotes;

_"Without exception, every animal species studied to date sleeps, or engages in something remarkably like it."_

_"Humans are not sleeping the way nature intended. The number of sleep bouts, the duration of sleep, and when sleep occurs have all been comprehensively distorted by modernity."_

There is much more to read and digest. There are two other books I want to recommend:

* Counting Sheep by Paul Martin
* Sleep by Nick Littlehales

If there is one book you need to read it's [Sleep](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sleep-Hours-Power-Naps-Recharge/dp/0241975972/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1526804747&sr=8-1&keywords=sleep+nick+littlehales), make it this one. It tells you how you should be sleeping and with a little planning and thought you can achieve great sleep.

**The Clever Guts Diet**: [How to revolutionise your body from the inside out](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1780723040/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) Michael Mosley takes us on an interesting journey through our digestive system—describing the travels of his 'pill camera.' Scientists are realising how important the microbiome in our gut are and I've been fascinated by this over the last few years. Finding something easy to 'digest' has not been easy, but this book changes things. Whether you eat plant based or not, I think you should read this book. It may change how you look at food.

Michael Mosley, explains _“Your gut is astonishingly clever. It contains millions of neurons - as many as you would find in the brain of a cat - and is home to the microbiome, trillions of microbes that influence your mood, your immune system, and even your appetite.”_
