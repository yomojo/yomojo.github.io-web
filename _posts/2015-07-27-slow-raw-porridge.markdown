This has been my go to food for a long while and it's what we started ZUKINI with. During the recent National Vegetarian Week food demo at the Friends Meeting House it was a huge hit with everyone. What we really enjoy is that's it's really simple to make.

A short video showing you how I make slow porridge. This is as good or better than overnight porridge. It’s easy to make—just follow the instructions on the video. I flake my own oats using a cereal flaker but you can just use normal oats or whatever else you want to. The quantities are approximate:

### Slow raw porridge ingredients

* 1 cup of almond milk

* 1/4 cup of oats

* 3 medjool dates

* Small piece of vanilla bean

* 1tsp cacao powder

* 1 large apricot

* 1tbsp pumpkin seeds

* tsp coconut
