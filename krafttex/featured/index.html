<p>It’s a very hard wearing material. It will age beautifully with wrinkles and creases but it will remain strong. It can be washed—if you want to. If it gets wet, once dry it will have a softer texture. All the products I make using Kraft-Tex are hand stitched using traditional leather work techniques and using plantbased materials.</p>
