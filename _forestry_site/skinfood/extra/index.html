<h2 id="uses-of-fab-products">Uses of FAB products</h2>

<p>They are simple, multi-use, unisex products. You can use them for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Washing</li>
  <li>Moisturising</li>
  <li>Shaving - FAB oil only</li>
  <li>Hair</li>
  <li>Nails and cuticles</li>
  <li>Deodarant - FAB_04 deodarant only</li>
</ul>

<p>The best way to use them is when you’re having shower (bath) during or after or both, while your body is wet.</p>

<h3 id="for-the-oil">For the oil</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dab some onto your finger or cotton cloth. It’s super-concentrated so don’t use too much.</li>
  <li>You can now apply it to any part of your hair, face or body.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-the-butter">For the butter</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scoop a pea size amount onto your finger. It’s super-concentrated so don’t use too much.</li>
  <li>Melt into your palms to soften it.</li>
  <li>You can apply it to any part of your face or body.</li>
</ul>

<p>To wash: rub all over your body, with your hands or a cotton cloth and rinse off. Once you finish your shower, you can apply some more while still wet. The wetness helps the oil or butter spread with ease over a large area.</p>

<p>If you want to use it for moisturising apply once you finish your shower, while you’re still wet—for the best effect.</p>

<p>You can also use the butter with the oil, for double the effect. Apply the oil first and then the butter on top. This is very effective for cracked skin</p>

<h3 id="for-the-deodarant">For the deodarant</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Dab some onto your finger tip and rub on armpit—repeat on the other side.</li>
</ul>

<p>You only need to use a small amount of this oil. Don’t use it like normal deodarant. One dap on your armpits works great. You can also dab some around your neck or ears for a great woody sweet smell.</p>

<h3 id="shaving">Shaving</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Wet face with hot water.</li>
  <li>Dab oil onto finger and rub well.</li>
  <li>Wet face again with hot water.</li>
  <li>Wet razor and start to shave. You will need to rinse your razor often. Single or double edged razors work best.</li>
  <li>Repeat from 1-4 again, shaving in the opposite direction.</li>
  <li>Dab oil onto finger and rub over face when you finish shaving.</li>
  <li>Clean the razor thoroughly after use and <strong>be careful</strong> of the sharp blade.</li>
</ol>

<p><em><strong>It’s super concentrated, so a little goes a long way!</strong></em></p>
