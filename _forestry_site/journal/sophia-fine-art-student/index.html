                <h3 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you-do">Who are you and what do you do?</h3>
<p>I am Sophia and I am a fine art student. I also work with adults with learning disabilities and I am a local coordinator for The Black Fish.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-have-you-been-eating-plant-based-foods-and-what-made-you-get-into-plant-foods">How long have you been eating plant based foods and what made you get into plant foods?</h3>
<p>I couldn’t bare the thought of eating a living thing as a child and stopped eating animals. I chose to abstain from animal products altogether at the age of 17 after watching Earthlings and realising that animals are born, abused and killed for more than just their flesh.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-like-making-food-and-what-are-your-favourite-foods">Do you like making food and what are your favourite foods?</h3>
<p>I love cooking! I make almost everything from scratch. My favourite treat is a cacao Raw Bite with a cup of fresh coffee.</p>

<h3 id="describe-your-day-with-plant-foods">Describe your day with plant foods.</h3>
<p>I eat in abundance. I make up a large batch of beans and legumes, rice and plenty of soaked seeds every evening and this makes up the base of 3 or 4 of my meals for the following day. My first meal is usually overnight oats made with almond milk, a good amount of chia or flaxseed, fruit and a side of tofu. I eat fruits, vegetables with dressing, nut and seed butters on rye bread or oat cakes, muesli and coconut oil throughout the day too!</p>

<h3 id="whats-your-favourite-kitchen-toolgadget">What’s your favourite kitchen tool/gadget?</h3>
<p>I don’t generally use any tools that are out of the ordinary! Occasionally I purchase a cheap hand held blender, but I am notoriously good at breaking them on frozen fruits!</p>

<h3 id="what-one-food-could-you-not-live-without-and-which-food-do-you-miss-the-most-since-switching-to-plant-based-foods">What one food could you not live without and which food do you miss the most since switching to plant based foods?</h3>
<p>I can’t isolate one food that I couldn’t live without! Perhaps celery spoons and jars of nut butter? The only thing I miss is a boiled egg and soldiers.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-you-consider-the-most-important-foods-in-your-diet-and-why">What do you consider the most important foods in your diet and why?</h3>
<p>All of the foods I eat have importance. I am an unofficial athlete and they all have a unique role in providing energy, focus, helping me to build and recover and in bringing me enjoyment.</p>

<h3 id="would-you-say-you-look-and-feel-more-healthy-and-how-has-eating-plant-foods-changed-you">Would you say you look and feel more healthy and how has eating plant foods changed you?</h3>
<p>I think it has made me more aware of my environmental footprint and more appreciative of whole foods and nature’s bounty. I do feel healthier than I did as a non-vegan. I don’t recall having a headache since I made the transition. I used to get regular migraines. I also consider myself a bit of an athlete now :) Sometimes it feels as though my cells are buzzing.</p>

<h3 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-someone-who-is-thinking-about-getting-into-plant-based-foods">What advice would you give to someone who is thinking about getting into plant based foods.</h3>
<p>Do it. Eat whole foods in abundance and enjoy it :)</p>
