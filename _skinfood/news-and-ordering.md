##### dab and scoop

When I say 'dab', what I mean is that you place your finger tip over the slim bottle and flip bottle upside down—then flip bottle rightways and remove finger. Or dip your finger into the bottle with the wider neck. The oil left on the end of finger is a 'dab'.

When I say scoop, I don't mean take as a large amount that will fit onto your finger but quite the opposite. Take a small amount as possible with the end of your finger—about the size of a pea.
