## Don't kill the bacteria on your skin

Skincare today uses a myriad of chemicals toxic to the bacteria that exist within our skin. These bacteria protect our skin and live in harmony with us and have done so for thousands of years. Being ‘squeaky clean’ has its consequences. We end up destroying the food source the good bacteria live off and kill them.

This can create problems like irritation, blemishes, redness, greasiness, and dryness. We then classify these as, skin types. They are symptoms of unbalanced skin.

## Balance your skin with natural ingredients

Use oil to clean, exfoliate and moisturise the skin. Made of the finest natural oil, like **human sebum** and rich in minerals and vitamins. Free from petrochemicals, artificial or synthetic ingredients. Each product contains less than five natural plant-based ingredients. Humans used for testing **FAB**.

## Why I don't use soap

Soap is made from a chemical reaction with oil and lye. That reaction (saponification) changes the makeup of the oil and lye. The lye is no longer present. Very little of the oil remains after saponification. Depending on how much oil is added to the mixture. Soap is a harsh cleaner for me and many people. My skin has always felt dry after using soap. I have to moisturise myself—which rarely worked with products which were as harmful to my skin. Soap strips the natural oils and bacteria from your skin—that’s not what we should be doing. FAB oil is not going to be harsh on your skin and you won’t have to moisturise yourself after washing with the oil. You’ll smell your natural self. Your natural skin bacteria will love you and your skin will improve.
