## What's wrong with modern skincare

Skincare today uses a myriad of chemicals toxic to the bacteria that exist within our skin. These bacteria protect our skin and live in harmony with us and have done so for thousands of years. Being ‘squeaky clean’ has its consequences. We end up destroying the food source the good bacteria live off and killing them off.

This can create problems like irritation, blemishes, redness, greasiness, and dryness. We then classify these as, skin types. They are symptoms of unbalanced skin.

### What does FAB promise?

It’s not going to fix your life for you or your sleep problems. There is a great book on sleep you should (must) read; Why We Sleep by Mathew Walker.

FAB oil and butter are **simple, multi-purpose, unisex** products. You can use them all over your **hair, face and body**. They are suitable for all hair and skin types. Their look, appearance and texture are not formulated to be a certain way—it is all natural. Because they are **super-concentrated**, a little goes a really long way. They will help nourish and protect your skin and hair. In the most natural-ethical way possible, without destroying the good bacteria that live within your skin and hair.
