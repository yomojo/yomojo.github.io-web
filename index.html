                <p>The beautiful woody rich scent of cedarwood—together with Jojoba oil, Seabuckthorn, Vitamin E makes for an impressive beard and hair oil. It’s non greasy, concentrated—you only need to use a small amount, and made from completely natural plant-based ingredients.</p>

<p>You can shave with it too! I’ve been using it for the last few months and love it.</p>

                This is a dish with lots of strong flavours and textures made using the whole marrow and some imagination. It's really easy and cheap to make.

                Pineapple coconut ice cream made with only four ingredients and no added sugar. This is more than just yummy—this is your mind hallucinating on another level! It's super easy to make too.

                A salad with a kick of ginger, that's quick and easy to make. It has bags of flavour and it can be made in about five minutes!

                   <h3>Plant Based Eating</h3>

                <p>Having a plant-based lifestyle does not need to be complex. It is about common sense. I’ve created a simple guide to help you think about plant-based eating. It’s not a definitive guide—these are my personal ideas on plant-based foods. You can print this out and stick it on your wall. It will print to any size—it’s designed to print at A3.</p>

<p>Download your free guide: <a href="https://jumpshare.com/v/HSd8DS5oWUyeuV4kvZae">Plant Based Food &amp; Eating Well Guide</a>. I’m not going to ask you to sign up to anything or ask you for your email. This is completely free.</p>

<h4 id="definition-of-veganism">Definition of Veganism</h4>
<p><em>A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.</em></p>

<p>The important part is; <strong>to exclude-as far as is possible and practicable</strong>. There are enough wars and hatred going in this world. Let’s not do this with Veganism, or be embarrassed about it. There will be people on both sides who will see it differently. Decide for yourself how much you can do. If you want more inspiration, take a look at the <a href="https://yomojo.co.uk/interviews/">Interviews</a> of people, from all walks of life, that have switched to a plant-based life. It was easy for me because I had over a decade to prepare for it. You can read more about <a href="https://yomojo.co.uk/home/featured/">my plant-based journey</a>.</p>

                   <h3>Our Planet</h3>

                <p>We cannot wait for politicians and organisations to do something about the state of our planet. We can all do something right now. Each one of us is capable of making a small contribution that will count. Here is a list of suggestions and you can start now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be kind to everyone—love is a great place to start.</li>
  <li>Reduce the amount of plastic you use—shopping bags are used everyday by millions of people—why not start here. There are so many great re-useable bags available.</li>
  <li>Encourage your local café and restaurant to use plant-based containers. They are widely available now.</li>
  <li>Buy food you only need—stop wasting it. Also, cook only want you are going to eat.</li>
  <li>Reduce the amount of packaged food you buy.</li>
  <li>Want to buy extra food? Then donate it to a food bank.</li>
  <li>Use your car less, walk more and use a bicycle.</li>
  <li>Do you need ‘three’ cars in your household?</li>
  <li>Stop buying something just because it’s cheap. Are you going to use it should be your first question? Not the fact that you can throw it away and buy another one in a few months.</li>
  <li>Buy a more sustainable version of the item.</li>
  <li>Consider buying second-hand items.</li>
  <li>Repair broken items, if they cannot be repaired recycle them where possible.</li>
  <li>Don’t want something? Then don’t throw it away, donate it to a charity or someone.</li>
  <li>Buy locally if you can.</li>
  <li>Do something for nothing</li>
  <li>Feed birds and small animals in your garden</li>
  <li>Grow flowers that are good for wildlife, especially bees.</li>
</ul>
