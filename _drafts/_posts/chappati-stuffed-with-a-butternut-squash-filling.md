This is my take on a popular Indian dish. The stuffing is normally made from lentils, sweetened with lots of sugar and there is quite a bit of fat. It's taken me a few months to rethink it but it's worked out really well.

There are two parts to this recipe. They are not complicated but can take a bit of time if you've never made anything like this. If you've made chapatis before, then it should be really easy.

### Butternut Squash Filling—Ingredients

* Butternut squash
* Olive oil
* Sweetner of choice
* Saffron
* Cardamon

### Method

1. Remove skin from butternut squash and cut in half.
2. Remove seeds from butternut squash and cut into medium sized chunks.
3. Boil the butternut squash in a pan full of water until it just starts to give. This part is optional.
4. Place the butternut squash chunks in a large baking dish, drizzle with olive oil and bake at 200ºC or Gas 5 for about 30 minutes—until the chunks are soft. If you did not do step 3, then it will take longer for the chunks to go soft.
