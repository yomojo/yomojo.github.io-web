This is my take on a popular Indian dish. The stuffing is normally made from lentils, sweetened with lots of sugar and there is quite a bit of fat. It's taken me a few months to rethink it but it's worked out really well.

There are two parts to this recipe. They are not complicated but can take a bit of time if you've never made anything like this. If you've made chapatis before, then it should be really easy.

### Butternut Squash Filling—Ingredients

* Butternut squash
* Olive oil
* Sweetner of choice
* Saffron
* Cardamon

I've not stated any quantities because it will depend on the size of the butternut squash you use, how sweet and intense you want the flavours of the filling you want.

### Method

1. Remove skin from butternut squash and cut in half.
2. Remove seeds from butternut squash and cut into medium sized chunks.
3. Boil the butternut squash in a pan full of water until it just starts to give. This part is optional.
4. Place the butternut squash chunks in a large baking dish, drizzle with olive oil and bake at 200ºC or Gas 5 for about 30 minutes—until the chunks are soft. If you did not do step 3, then it will take longer for the chunks to go soft.
5. Put the chunks in a large pan.
6. Add sweetener of choice. If it's liquid be careful not to make the filling to wet.
