This is my take on a popular Indian dish. The stuffing is normally made from lentils, sweetened with lots of sugar and there is quite a bit of fat. It's taken me a few months to rethink it but it's worked out really well and it's a much healthier way to make them.

There are three parts to this recipe. They are not complicated but can take a bit of time if you've never made anything like this. If you've made chapatis before, then it should be really easy.

### Butternut Squash Filling—Ingredients

* Butternut squash
* Olive oil
* Sweetner of choice
* Saffron
* Cardamon

I've not stated any quantities because it will depend on the size of the butternut squash you use, how sweet and intense you want the flavours of the filling you want.

### Method

 1. Remove skin from butternut squash and cut in half.
 2. Remove seeds from butternut squash and cut into medium sized chunks.
 3. Boil the butternut squash in a pan full of water until it just starts to give. This part is optional.
 4. Place the butternut squash chunks in a large baking dish, drizzle with olive oil and bake at 200ºC or Gas 5 for about 30 minutes—until the chunks are soft. If you did not do step 3, then it will take longer for the chunks to go soft. Probably about an hour or so.
 5. Put the chunks in a large pan.
 6. Add sweetener of choice. If it's liquid be careful not to make the filling to wet. I would probably add a liquid sweetener once the mixture is nearly ready to use.
 7. Add some cardamon—be careful how much you add because you easily use too much. Start off with a ¼ tsp.
 8. Add some saffron—a good pinch. The best way to add it, is first to heat a tablespoon gently, place the saffron in the spoon and let them 'dry' from the heat of the spoon. You can then crumble the saffron between your fingers and add them to the pan.
 9. Start to mash the butternut squash chunks. You could do this in a blender or food processor. If you have a potato masher it should work fine. Once it's all mashed up—you should have a smooth filling. Check the flavours and sweetness—adjust accordingly if needed.
10. Let the filling cool.

Now to make the chapatis. If you've made them before, you can skip the instructions below and just go on to the third part.

### Chapati Ingredients

* Chapati flour or a bread flour
* Olive oil
* Warm water

### Method

1. Add 2 cups of chapati flour to a large mixing bowl
2. Add 1 tbsp of olive oil and rub it into the flour
3. Add some warm water to the flour mixture but only a little at a time until most the flour just starts to stick together. Don't over add water—otherwise the dough will be too wet.
4. Begin to kneed the dough for about five minutes.
5. Let the dough rest for about ten minutes. It should be soft and have good elasticity.
