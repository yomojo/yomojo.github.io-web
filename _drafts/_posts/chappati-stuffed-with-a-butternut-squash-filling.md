This is my take on a popular Indian dish. The stuffing is normally made from lentils, sweetened with lots of sugar and there is quite a bit of fat. It's taken me a few months to rethink it but it's worked out really well.

There are two parts to this recipe. They are not complicated but can take a bit of time if you've never made anything like this. If you've made chapatis before, then it should be really easy.
