                <h2 id="it-started-with-jack-fruit-in-india">It started with Jack fruit in India</h2>

<p>I was in India touring the south and Jack fruit season was starting and so my sister and her husband knew I love Jack fruit and decided to buy a wholeone for me! It was not quite ripe and would take several days to ripen—so I had to carry this huge thing around while travelling from city to city on public transport. When it was ripe enough I cut it with my tiny knife in the hotel room and if you’ve cut a fresh Jack fruit—then you know your hands can get really sticky. This ‘glue’ like substance is incredibly hard to clean off, as I was soon finding out. Then I had a light buld moment—what if I used oil to clean it off? I had some coconut oil in a tiny bottle and tried it. I could not believe how easily the gooey substance came off my hands.</p>

<p>This is where the idea for FAB was born and it’s taken a few years to come up with a simple range of multiuse products. I use these products everyday from cleaning, mositurising and protecting—they just work.</p>

<h2 id="dont-kill-the-bacteria-on-your-skin">Don’t kill the bacteria on your skin</h2>

<p>Skincare today uses a myriad of chemicals toxic to the bacteria that exist within our skin. These bacteria protect our skin and live in harmony with us and have done so for thousands of years. Being ‘squeaky clean’ has its consequences. We end up destroying the food source the good bacteria live off and kill them.</p>

<p>This can create problems like irritation, blemishes, redness, greasiness, and dryness. We then classify these as, skin types. They are symptoms of unbalanced skin.</p>

<h2 id="balance-your-skin-with-natural-ingredients">Balance your skin with natural ingredients</h2>

<p>Use oil to clean, exfoliate and moisturise the skin. Made of the finest natural oil, like <strong>human sebum</strong> and rich in minerals and vitamins. Free from petrochemicals, artificial or synthetic ingredients. Each product contains less than five natural plant-based ingredients. Humans used for testing <strong>FAB</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-dont-use-soap">Why I don’t use soap</h2>

<p>Soap is made from a chemical reaction with an oil and lye. That reaction (saponification) changes the make up of the oil and lye. The lye is no longer there and very little of the oil remains after saponification—depending on how much oil is added to the mixture. Soap is a <strong>harsh cleaner</strong> for me and probably for many people. My skin has always felt dry after using soap and I have to mositurise myself—which rarely worked with products which were just as harmful to my skin. Soap strips the natural oils and bacteria from your skin—that’s not what we should be doing. FAB oil is not going to be harsh on your skin and you won’t have to mositurise yourself after washing with the oil. You’ll smell your natural self. Your natural skin bacteria will love you and your skin will improve very quickly.</p>

<p>FAB products are <strong>simple, multi-purpose, unisex</strong> products. You can use them all over your <strong>hair, face and body</strong>. They are suitable for all hair and skin types. Their look, appearance and texture are not formulated to be a certain way—it is all natural. Because they are <strong>super-concentrated</strong>, a little goes a really long way. They will help nourish and protect your skin and hair. In the most natural-ethical way possible, without destroying the good bacteria that live within your skin and hair.</p>

<h5 id="dab-and-scoop">dab and scoop</h5>

<p>When I say ‘dab’, what I mean is that you place your finger tip over the slim bottle and flip bottle upside down—then flip bottle rightways and remove finger. Or dip your finger into the bottle with the wider neck. The oil left on the end of finger is a ‘dab’.</p>

<p>When I say scoop, I don’t mean take as a large amount that will fit onto your finger but quite the opposite. Take a small amount as possible with the end of your finger—about the size of a pea.</p>

                <h2 id="uses-of-fab-products">Uses of FAB products</h2>

<p>They are simple, multi-use, unisex products. You can use them for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Washing</li>
  <li>Moisturising</li>
  <li>Shaving - FAB oil only</li>
  <li>Hair</li>
  <li>Nails and cuticles</li>
  <li>Deodarant - FAB_04 deodarant only</li>
</ul>

<p>The best way to use them is when you’re having shower (bath) during or after or both, while your body is wet.</p>

<h3 id="for-the-oil">For the oil</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dab some onto your finger or cotton cloth. It’s super-concentrated so don’t use too much.</li>
  <li>You can now apply it to any part of your hair, face or body.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-the-butter">For the butter</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scoop a pea size amount onto your finger. It’s super-concentrated so don’t use too much.</li>
  <li>Melt into your palms to soften it.</li>
  <li>You can apply it to any part of your face or body.</li>
</ul>

<p>To wash: rub all over your body, with your hands or a cotton cloth and rinse off. Once you finish your shower, you can apply some more while still wet. The wetness helps the oil or butter spread with ease over a large area.</p>

<p>If you want to use it for moisturising apply once you finish your shower, while you’re still wet—for the best effect.</p>

<p>You can also use the butter with the oil, for double the effect. Apply the oil first and then the butter on top. This is very effective for cracked skin</p>

<h3 id="for-the-deodarant">For the deodarant</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Dab some onto your finger tip and rub on armpit—repeat on the other side.</li>
</ul>

<p>You only need to use a small amount of this oil. Don’t use it like normal deodarant. One dap on your armpits works great. You can also dab some around your neck or ears for a great woody sweet smell.</p>

<h3 id="shaving">Shaving</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Wet face with hot water.</li>
  <li>Dab oil onto finger and rub well.</li>
  <li>Wet face again with hot water.</li>
  <li>Wet razor and start to shave. You will need to rinse your razor often. Single or double edged razors work best.</li>
  <li>Repeat from 1-4 again, shaving in the opposite direction.</li>
  <li>Dab oil onto finger and rub over face when you finish shaving.</li>
  <li>Clean the razor thoroughly after use and <strong>be careful</strong> of the sharp blade.</li>
</ol>

<p><em><strong>It’s super concentrated, so a little goes a long way!</strong></em></p>
