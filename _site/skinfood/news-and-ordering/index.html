<p>When I say ‘dab’, what I mean is that you place your finger tip over the bottle and flip bottle upside down—then flip bottle rightways and remove finger. The oil left on the end of finger is a ‘dab’.</p>

<p>When I say scoop, I don’t mean take as a large amount that will fit onto your finger but quite the opposite. Take a small amount as possible with the end of your finger—the size of a lentil. Seems ridiculous but trust me :)</p>
