<p>The FAB_04 deodorant will not interfere with your perfume or make-up. It’s a unisex product. I use it everyday</p>

<p>FAB_04 is scented with sandalwood, making it a great smelling deodorant. The 5ml pot is <strong>transportable and easy to use</strong>. Fab when you need to use it any time of the day.</p>

                <p>Made with simple, finest quality, plant-based, ingredients. FAB_04 Deodorant is only made in limited batches.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>: *Jojoba Oil, *Sandalwood.<br />
*Organic ingredient.</p>

<p>Jojoba oil contains natural minerals and vitamins. The chemical profile of jojoba oil is like human sebum. Sandalwood is a deep woody oil with sweet tones.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>How to use</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Dab some onto your finger tip and rub on armpit—repeat on the other side.</li>
</ol>

<p>You only need to use a small amount of this oil. Don’t use it like normal deodorant. One dap on your armpits works great. You can also dab some around your neck or ears for a great woody sweet smell.</p>

<hr />

<p>Allergy warnings: As with all nut based carrier oils, always use with caution on people with nut allergies.</p>
