                <p>I came across Sofie’s Instagram account by accident one day and I found it really refreshing to see someone having so much fun with being plant based. Go take a look at her fabulous <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sofievandenbrande/">Instagram account</a>.</p>

<h3 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you">Who are you and what do you?</h3>
<p>My name is Sofie, I’m 26 years old and live in Belgium. I’m a bakers daughter and so bread is my ever lasting love. I have a full time job as a banker and in my spare time I love to cook, eat and explore vegan food.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/making-breakfast.jpeg" alt="making-breakfast" /><br />
<em>Making breakfast</em></p>

<p>Next to my love for plant based food I also adore sports. I run 8K every morning and in the evening I love to go to the gym as well. I’m also interested in yoga, boxing and spinning classes.</p>

<p>A month ago I started to take steps in becoming a chef—I want to become a cook so I can open my own vegan eatery or catering business one day.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-have-you-been-eating-plant-based-foods-and-what-made-you-get-into-plant-foods">How long have you been eating plant based foods and what made you get into plant foods?</h3>
<p>I’ve been a vegetarian since I was 6 years old. About a year ago I choose to become a vegan—because plant based food gives me more energy, and I can eat a lot without gaining weight :). It’s better for the environment and animals. My skin looks clearer,… and IT IS SOOOOOOO YUM :) I look forward to every single meal.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-like-making-food-and-what-are-your-favourite-foods">Do you like making food and what are your favourite foods?</h3>
<p>Yes, I absolutely adore making food. That’s the reason why I want to make a profession out of it. Nearly every Saturday I’m making plant based healthy food for my Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sofievandenbrande/">@sofievandenbrande</a> for the whole day.</p>

<h4 id="sofie-van-den-brande">SOFIE Van Den Brande</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>It feels so good just to know that no animal has to suffer because I want to live</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My favourite foods:
Plant based yoghurt, fruits especially; blueberries, raspberries, mango, a sweet apple, kiwi, pineapple…<br />
All kinds of veggies<br />
Bread! :)<br />
Salads</p>

<h3 id="describe-your-day-with-plant-foods">Describe your day with plant foods.</h3>
<p>I start with 125g plant based yoghurt, 125g blueberries and vegan cereals—tastes like vanilla and almond plus green tea<br />
10am—some tomatoes<br />
12pm—a homemade salad with lettuce, tomatoes, grated carrots, celery, red beet, peppers, beans or avocado and tofu. + green tea and sometimes 1 slice of bread<br />
4pm—a vegan protein bar<br />
7pm—a hot vegan meal—for example wok with tempeh, chickpea stew with rice and veggies, wraps with a tomato sauce and falafel,…so always lots of veggies with protein like tempeh, beans or tofu<br />
9pm—an apple with vegan vanilla yoghurt plus green tea</p>

<em>Vanilla raspberry muffins</em></p>

<h3 id="whats-your-favourite-kitchen-toolgadget">What’s your favourite kitchen tool/gadget?</h3>
<p>A food processor for sure! I use it for everything :)</p>

<h3 id="what-one-food-could-you-not-live-without-and-which-food-do-you-miss-the-most-since-switching-to-plant-based-foods">What one food could you not live without and which food do you miss the most since switching to plant based foods?</h3>

<p>I could not live without yoghurt, bread, cereals, fruits and veggies. I miss cheese the most… feta or mozzarella</p>

<h3 id="what-do-you-consider-the-most-important-foods-in-your-diet-and-why">What do you consider the most important foods in your diet and why?</h3>
<p>Without a doubt veggies, fruits, yoghurt and tofu.</p>

<h3 id="would-you-say-you-look-and-feel-more-healthy">Would you say you look and feel more healthy?</h3>
<p>Yes absolutely! I have lots of energy, I feel happy!
I have a clear skin now. It’s strange but also my mind is healthier…I’m so much more positive now.</p>

<h3 id="how-has-eating-plant-foods-changed-you">How has eating plant foods changed you?</h3>
<p>It changed my health, mindset and physical appearance. I feel and look healthier! I gained more self esteem because I lost 15kg in two years. It’s like I’m on top of the world and it feels so good just to know that no animal has to suffer because I want to live.</p>

<h3 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-someone-who-is-thinking-about-getting-into-plant-based-foods">What advice would you give to someone who is thinking about getting into plant based foods?</h3>
<p>Start with baby steps…Replace maybe the first month with 1 meal—for example breakfast with a vegan alternative. You’ll still have lots of food choices and you might be already eating lots of other vegan meals.</p>

<p>Make it a food adventure :) and explore as much as you can. The fun part is…discovering new things.</p>

Sofie</p>
