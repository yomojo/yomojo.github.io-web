                <h3 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you-do">Who are you and what do you do?</h3>
<p>I am me, Jarvis and I’m 22 years young, Right now I work part time and mainly love reading, living in presence, eating organic plant based meals and drawing.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-have-you-been-eating-plant-based-foods-and-what-made-you-get-into-plant-foods">How long have you been eating plant based foods and what made you get into plant foods?</h3>
<p>I became vegan in October 2014 so roughly 8/9 months. I’ve always been very open minded and never attached to food, when I met my lover she was eating small amounts of meat mainly white meat but in general she was already on a healthy path and I carried on eating junk, pizza’s, microwave meals, heavily smoking, energy drinks, coca cola late at night… and then in early October I  began having major mood swings, I became emotionally unstable and felt I’ve got to change something so I adopted my lovers diet and after speaking with a colleague about smoking I quit and became vegan the next day, the transition was a lot easier with the support of my lover.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-like-making-food-and-what-are-your-favourite-foods">Do you like making food and what are your favourite foods?</h3>
<p>I love creating so making food is something I find joy in. My favourite foods are vegetables I do love broccoli, pasta and tomato dishes and I also love marinated curry potato cubes with a special dip I make with cashews and sundried tomatoes.</p>

<h3 id="describe-your-day-with-plant-foods">Describe your day with plant foods.</h3>
<p>So I wake up, 1ltr of fluoride free filtered water… Breakfast: 5/6 banana smoothie with baobab and sesame seeds (once a week with organic coffee), Lunch: Pasta/ potatoes with a tomato or curryish kind of sauce and organic vegetables, I’ll usually snack on bananas and dates before my dinner which is similar to my lunch.</p>

<h3 id="whats-your-favourite-kitchen-toolgadget">What’s your favourite kitchen tool/gadget?</h3>
<p>Its got to be the blender I make all sorts of tasty treats and sauces in it.</p>

<h3 id="what-one-food-could-you-not-live-without-and-which-food-do-you-miss-the-most-since-switching-to-plant-based-foods">What one food could you not live without and which food do you miss the most since switching to plant based foods?</h3>
<p>Bananas and dates!! I miss nothing this Plant based diet has increased my energy, cleared my skin, opened my eyes to life and I believe is helping me so much with my spiritual journey.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-you-consider-the-most-important-foods-in-your-diet-and-why">What do you consider the most important foods in your diet and why?</h3>
<p>Fruit and vegetables with plenty carbs a consistent amount of energy is something I truly value they tend to give me a very positive body high too, I’ve found that eating plenty vegetables everyday allows me go to that place of stillness and find clarity a lot easier.</p>

<h3 id="would-you-say-you-look-and-feel-healthier">Would you say you look and feel healthier?</h3>
<p>YES! I love it, It has been a challenge because I went from tonnes of sugar and crap a day to nothing overnight but being able to access my natural energy and tap into my higher self is something I’ll never compromise again.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/jarvis-selfie.jpg" alt="jarvis selfie" /></p>

<h4 id="how-has-eating-plant-foods-changed-you">How has eating plant foods changed you?</h4>
<p>I have compassion for all life on earth, I discovered a part of me I would have never found other wise, I’m able to get up and move, I can think sharper, my love life is stronger, it’s also made me realise that there’s so much that eating an organic plant based lifestyle can do for the planet and those close to us. By eating organic we reduce the amount of poisons that conventional farms use, allow other beings to live in harmony. By eating a cruelty free, organic and plant based diet we stop supporting obesity, we stop supporting modern day disease, pollution, animal cruelty and overall destruction of the planet.</p>

<h3 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-someone-who-is-thinking-about-getting-into-plant-based-foods">What advice would you give to someone who is thinking about getting into plant based foods.</h3>
<p>I simply say… Just do it forget thinking too much, your mind will come up with all kinds of excuses start looking at why, do it smartly. It requires only a few moments each day to jump on the internet and type organic vegetables and plant based eating.</p>

<p>Begin by reducing your refined sugar and dairy intake immediately, switch from those crappy sugar ridden bars to fruit, dates and bananas are a great place to start. Buy a stainless steel steamer, you’ll find that steaming veggies is so quick if you’re busy, buy a blender too, nothing fancy just one with a sharp blade. Step two replace conventional veggies and fruit to organic especially things you eat the skin of like apples and tomatoes, things you don’t eat the skin of are okay but try and get organic if possible; many super markets sell organic now and they’re easy to spot.</p>

<p>Reduce rancid oils, use organic coconut oil when cooking.</p>

<p>Make sure you eat plenty of carbs during the day such as pasta, potatoes, rice and bread with your meals it doesn’t have to be all of them in one day but pick and choose as you love.</p>

<p>Reduce your meat intake to once a week or drop immediately. Start eating different types of beans such as butter beans, aduki, pinto, cannellini or haricot.</p>

<p>Look to wholefoods for good health instead of products and supplements, they usually contain chemicals and unnecessary ingredients, take a few moments if you do want to buy a product and look at the ingredients, if you don’t know what something is, put it down and look online.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reduce sugar, meat and dairy intake or stop immediately if you’re well informed where to begin.</li>
  <li>Buy a steamer and blender</li>
  <li>Get organic</li>
  <li>Look for bulk of rice, potatoes or beans</li>
  <li>Look online- Organic, vegan, plant based, rawtill4.</li>
  <li>Meditate, meditate, meditate it goes like bum on chair with plant based eating ;)</li>
</ul>
