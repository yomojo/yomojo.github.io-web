        <h3 class="title is-size-4">I think sleeping and what we eat are important</h3>
                <p>Three books that we should all read.</p>

<p><strong>Why We Sleep</strong>: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-We-Sleep-Science-Dreams-ebook/dp/B06Y649387/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1512589383&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=why+we+sleep">The new science of sleep</a> Mathew Walker says that sleep is not an option but necessary. He explains in easy terms the science behind sleep. Over 60 years of reserach are in this book. He says, <em>“Sleep is non-negotiable.”</em> A few more quotes;</p>

<p><em>“Without exception, every animal species studied to date sleeps, or engages in something remarkably like it.”</em></p>

<p><em>“Humans are not sleeping the way nature intended. The number of sleep bouts, the duration of sleep, and when sleep occurs have all been comprehensively distorted by modernity.”</em></p>

<p>There is much more to read and digest. There are two other books I want to recommend:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Counting Sheep by Paul Martin</li>
  <li>Sleep by Nick Littlehales</li>
</ul>

<p>If there is one book you need to read it’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sleep-Hours-Power-Naps-Recharge/dp/0241975972/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1526804747&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sleep+nick+littlehales">Sleep</a>, make it this one. It tells you how you should be sleeping and with a little planning and thought you can achieve great sleep.</p>

<p><strong>The Clever Guts Diet</strong>: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1780723040/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">How to revolutionise your body from the inside out</a> Michael Mosley takes us on an interesting journey through our digestive system—describing the travels of his ‘pill camera.’ Scientists are realising how important the microbiome in our gut are and I’ve been fascinated by this over the last few years. Finding something easy to ‘digest’ has not been easy, but this book changes things. Whether you eat plant based or not, I think you should read this book. It may change how you look at food.</p>

<p>Michael Mosley, explains <em>“Your gut is astonishingly clever. It contains millions of neurons - as many as you would find in the brain of a cat - and is home to the microbiome, trillions of microbes that influence your mood, your immune system, and even your appetite.”</em></p>

                   <h3>Plant Based Eating</h3>

                <p>Having a plant-based lifestyle does not need to be complex. It is about common sense. I’ve created a simple guide to help you think about plant-based eating. It’s not a definitive guide—these are my personal ideas on plant-based foods. You can print this out and stick it on your wall. It will print to any size—it’s designed to print at A3.</p>

<p>Download your free guide: <a href="https://jumpshare.com/v/HSd8DS5oWUyeuV4kvZae">Plant Based Food &amp; Eating Well Guide</a>. I’m not going to ask you to sign up to anything or ask you for your email. This is completely free.</p>

<h4 id="definition-of-veganism">Definition of Veganism</h4>
<p><em>A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.</em></p>

<p>The important part is; <strong>to exclude-as far as is possible and practicable</strong>. There are enough wars and hatred going in this world. Let’s not do this with Veganism, or be embarrassed about it. There will be people on both sides who will see it differently. Decide for yourself how much you can do. If you want more inspiration, take a look at the <a href="https://yomojo.co.uk/interviews/">Interviews</a> of people, from all walks of life, that have switched to a plant-based life. It was easy for me because I had over a decade to prepare for it. You can read more about <a href="https://yomojo.co.uk/home/featured/">my plant-based journey</a>.</p>

                   <h3>Our Planet</h3>
               
                <p>We cannot wait for politicians and organisations to do something about the state of our planet. We can all do something right now. Each one of us is capable of making a small contribution that will count. Here is a list of suggestions and you can start now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be kind to everyone—love is a great place to start.</li>
  <li>Reduce the amount of plastic you use—shopping bags are used everyday by millions of people—why not start here. There are so many great re-useable bags available.</li>
  <li>Encourage your local café and restaurant to use plant-based containers. They are widely available now.</li>
  <li>Buy food you only need—stop wasting it. Also, cook only want you are going to eat.</li>
  <li>Reduce the amount of packaged food you buy.</li>
  <li>Want to buy extra food? Then donate it to a food bank.</li>
  <li>Use your car less, walk more and use a bicycle.</li>
  <li>Do you need ‘three’ cars in your household?</li>
  <li>Stop buying something just because it’s cheap. Are you going to use it should be your first question? Not the fact that you can throw it away and buy another one in a few months.</li>
  <li>Buy a more sustainable version of the item.</li>
  <li>Consider buying second-hand items.</li>
  <li>Repair broken items, if they cannot be repaired recycle them where possible.</li>
  <li>Don’t want something? Then don’t throw it away, donate it to a charity or someone.</li>
  <li>Buy locally if you can.</li>
  <li>Do something for nothing</li>
  <li>Feed birds and small animals in your garden</li>
  <li>Grow flowers that are good for wildlife, especially bees.</li>
</ul>
