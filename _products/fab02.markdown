excerpt: |-
  An all over face, body and hair butter. It does not feel greasy when applied. It's very concentrated and a little goes a long way.

  The FAB range will not interfere with your perfume or make-up. It's a multi-purpose, unisex product. You can use it on your:
  * Face
  * Body
  * Nails
  * Cracked  or flaky skin

  Use it for moisturising or washing. See instructions below.

    The **double FAB method** is when you appy the butter first, and then the oil on top. Try this to give you super soft skin. Especially great for when you have really dry, flaky or cracked skin.

  **Transportable and easy to use.**

Made with simple, finest quality, plant-based, ingredients. FAB_02 Butter is only made in limited batches. 

**Ingredients**: *Jojoba Butter, *Jojoba Oil, Sea Buckthorn, *Franckincense.  
*Organic ingredient.

Jojoba oil contains natural minerals and vitamins. The chemical profile of jojoba oil is like human sebum. Sea buckthorn is the richest oil on earth. It contains a high number of natural minerals and vitamins, and fatty acids. It has been used in Asia for 1,000 years. Frankincense has a fresh citrus type scent.

You only need to use a small amount of this butter. Don't use it like normal body butters and creams.

**Instructions**:
1. After showering, while you're still wet is the best time to use it.
2. Scoop a tiny amount with your finger and melt into your palms. Then apply all over your body and face. The water will help the butter emulsify and spread over a large area. A little will go a very long way.
3. Use it during the day on wet or dry skin.

**Combine FAB Butter and Oil**
1. Dab some oil first as per the instructions above, with or without wetting the skin.
2. Scoop some butter onto your finger and apply straight on top—no need to wet the skin. 

This gives you double the effect and it's great for cracked skin.

_**Remember—a little goes a long way!**_

For very dry skin use more.
