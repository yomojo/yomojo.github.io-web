excerpt: |-
  A sac that can be used for many things—from storage to shopping or even hiding ugly plant pots with an eco sac that has so much character. An eco plastic free storage sac. **Please note—that Kraft-Tex is washable but not waterproof**.
  
  **The sac will be packed flat. It will come creased and wrinkled—that is the nature of the material when it's used over a large area. This creates it's own unique character**.

  Machine stitched—you can choose from three material colours and two sizes currently.
