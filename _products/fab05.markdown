excerpt: |-
  The beautiful woody rich scent of cedarwood—together with Jojoba oil, Seabuckthorn, Vitamin E makes for an impressive beard and hair oil. It's non greasy, concentrated—you only need to use a small amount, and made from completely natural plant-based ingredients.

  It is a unisex product. If you don't have a beard—you can use it on your hair. I use it to shave with now instead of FAB_01 Oil. See video to see how I shave with the FAB_01 Oil. You can use it on your:
  * Face
  * Hair
  * Shaving

  **Transportable and easy to use.**

Jojoba oil contains natural minerals and vitamins. The chemical profile of jojoba oil is like human sebum. Sea buckthorn is the richest oil on earth. It contains a high number of natural minerals and vitamins, and fatty acids. It has been used in Asia for 1,000 years. Cedarwood Atlas has a woody, rich and balsamic scent.

You only need to use a small amount of this oil. See instructions below.

**Beard and hair application**:
1. Dab some onto your fingers. A little will go a very long way.
2. Gently massage into your beard or hair.
3. You can apply this on a wet beard or hair.

Use it during the day on wet or dry skin.

**Shaving with the oil**:
1. Wet face with hot water.
2. Dab onto finger and rub well.
3. Wet face again with hot water.
4. Wet razor and start to shave. You will need to rinse your razor often. Single or double edged razors work best. 
5. Repeat from 1-4 again, shaving in the opposite direction.
6. Dab some oil onto finger and massage onto face to finish off.
7. Clean the razor thoroughly after use and **be careful** of the sharp blade.

 _**Remember—a little goes a long way!**_
