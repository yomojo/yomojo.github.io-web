excerpt: |-
  A simple basket to store anything from food to non-food items.

   An eco plastic free storage bag. **Please note—that Kraft-Tex is washable but not waterproof**.
  
  **The bag will be packed flat. It will come creased and wrinkled—that is the nature of the material when it's used over a large area. This creates it's own unique character**.

  Machine stitched—you can choose from three material colours.
