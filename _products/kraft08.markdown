excerpt: |-
  A large Tote, that can carry lots of things. The thick (15mm) soft cotton cord handles (made in Norfolk) are stitched onto the Tote. As the Tote ages, it will crease and wrinkle beautifully. Quality Hoppe & Masztalerz brass fittings are used.
  
   **It will come creased and wrinkled—that is the nature of the material when it's used over a large area**. 

  You can choose from three colours. 
  
  Width x Height x Depth: 350mm x 340mm x 180mm
  Handles: 260mm High
