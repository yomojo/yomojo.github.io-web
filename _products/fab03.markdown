excerpt: |-
  An all over face and body butter. It does not feel greasy when applied. It's very concentrated and a little goes a long way.

  The FAB range will not interfere with your perfume or make-up. It's a multi-purpose, unisex product. You can use it on your:
  * Face
  * Lips
  * Body
  * Nails
  * Cracked  or flaky skin

  FAB_03 is unscented, making it a great lip balm. The 5ml pot is **transportable and easy to use**. Fab when you need to mositurise your lips at any time of the day.

  The **double FAB method** is when you appy the butter first, and then the oil on top. Try this to give you super soft skin. Especially great for when you have really dry, flaky or cracked skin.

You only need to use a small amount of this butter. Don't use it like normal body butters and creams.

**Combine FAB Butter and Oil**
1. Dab some oil first as per the instructions above, with or without wetting the skin.
2. Scoop some butter onto your finger and apply straight on top—no need to wet the skin. 

This gives you double the effect and it's great for cracked skin.

_**Remember—a little goes a long way!**_

For very dry skin use more.

Allergy warnings: As with all nut based carrier oils, always use with caution on people with nut allergies.
