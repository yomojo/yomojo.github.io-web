excerpt: |-
  An all over face, body and hair oil. It does not feel greasy when applied. It's very concentrated and a little goes a long way.

  The FAB range will not interfere with your perfume or make-up. It's a multi-purpose, unisex product. You can use it on your:
  * Face
  * Body
  * Hair
  * Nails/Cuticles
  * Lips
  * Cracked  or flaky skin
  * Shaving

  Use it for moisturising or washing. See instructions below.

  The **double FAB method** is when you appy the oil first, and then the butter on top. Try this to give you super soft skin. Especially great for when you have really dry, flaky or cracked skin.

  **Transportable and easy to use.**

  super-sensitive skin, it is versatile, transportable, easy to use and gentle and
  nourishing. The kindest product I have used xx

*Organic ingredient.

Jojoba oil contains natural minerals and vitamins. The chemical profile of jojoba oil is like human sebum. Sea buckthorn is the richest oil on earth. It contains a high number of natural minerals and vitamins, and fatty acids. It has been used in Asia for 1,000 years. Frankincense has a fresh citrus type scent.

You only need to use a small amount of this oil. Don't use it like normal body oil. See instructions below.

**Washing with the oil**:
1. During showering, wet your skin first.
2. Dab some onto your finger or cotton cloth. Then apply all over your body and face. The water will help the oil emulsify and spread over a large area. A little will go a very long way. This will not lather like soap :)
3. Rinse off and then apply some FAB butter to finish off.
4. If you're cleaning your face at night—wet face, rub some oil into your face gently.
5. Leave for a short while and then wipe off with a cotton towel.

Use it during the day on wet or dry skin.

**Shaving with the oil**:
1. Wet face with hot water.
2. Dab onto finger and rub well.
3. Wet face again with hot water.
4. Wet razor and start to shave. You will need to rinse your razor often. Single or double edged razors work best. 
5. Repeat from 1-4 again, shaving in the opposite direction.
6. Dab some oil onto finger and massage onto face to finish off.
7. Clean the razor thoroughly after use and **be careful** of the sharp blade.

 _**Remember—a little goes a long way!**_

For very dry skin use more.
