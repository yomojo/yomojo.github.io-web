excerpt: |-
  A deodarant made from natural oils, that does not block sweat pores on the skin. Perspiration is a natural homeostatic process, that secretes a salty fluid—why would you want to interfere with that? Which is what deodarants or antiperspirants made with lots of chemicals do—some even contain aluminium which is toxic. Sometimes that salty fluid can smell and FAB deodarant is a great way to clean the fluid and the sandalwood will leave a subtle beautiful smell on your armpit. FAB_04 deodarant does not feel greasy when applied. It's very concentrated and a little goes a long way.

  The FAB_04 deodarant will not interfere with your perfume or make-up. It's a unisex product. I use it everyday

  FAB_04 is scented with sandalwood, making it a great smelling deodarant. The 5ml pot is **transportable and easy to use**. Fab when you need to use it any time of the day.

**How to use**

1. Dab some onto your finger tip and rub on armpit—repeat on the other side.

You only need to use a small amount of this oil. Don't use it like normal deodorant. One dap on your armpits works great. You can also dab some around your neck or ears for a great woody sweet smell.
