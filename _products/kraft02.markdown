excerpt: |-
  An eco snack bag that can be used for taking your lunch, picnic or anything else you would like to carry in a small, portable eco bag not made with plastic! The bag is closed by folding the top and securing it with a string around two wooden buttons. **Please note—that Kraft-Tex is washable but not waterproof**.
  
  **The bag will be packed flat. It will come creased and wrinkled—that is the nature of the material when it's used over a large area. This creates it's own unique character**.

  Machine stitched—you can choose from three material colours.
