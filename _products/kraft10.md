excerpt: |-
  Introducing the new eco sac bin. A multi-use eco sac, made from plants that you can use as a bin with a washable liner made from 100% cotton?
  
  How would you like to use something that has no plastic and the inner bag is washable and reusable? And it looks beautiful.

  The liner is made from Calico. A plain-woven textile, made from half-processed and unbleached cotton fibres. Calico is un-dyed and raw. The liner can be washed seperately. Wash similar colours together.
