  Introducing the new eco sac bin liner. You can now use the eco sac (made from plants) as a bin with a washable liner made from 100% cotton? And two together look beautiful.

  The liner is made from Calico. A plain-woven textile, made from half-processed and unbleached cotton fibres. Calico is un-dyed and raw. The liner can be washed seperately. Wash similar colours together.
