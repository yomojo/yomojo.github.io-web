## Raw deliciousness

These are artisanal foods I make in small batches. Always freshly made.

## Chocolate Mulberries

Handmade with, organic, plant-based ingredients. They do not contain palm oil, refined sugar, artificial colours or flavours.

## Eating

You can snack on them as they are, add them to your breakfast or to a dessert. They are easy to carry with you and come in a resealable tub made of plants.

## The environment

Recyclable and compostable packaging is easy to adopt for anyone or any business. All that's required is a conscious commitment to using it. Yes, it can cost more, but that is insignificant to the damage we cause to the environment by not using it.
