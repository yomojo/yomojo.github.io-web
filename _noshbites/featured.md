## 100% Dark Chocolate Deliciousness

These are artisanal foods I make in small batches. Always freshly handmade with, organic, plant-based ingredients. They do not contain **palm oil, refined sugar, artificial colours or flavours**.

## Eating

You can snack on them as they are, add them to your breakfast or to a dessert. They are easy to carry with you and come in a cardboard box or if you buy them from the stores listed, in resealable tub made of plants.

## The environment

All the packaging used is recyclable and compostable. The only thing you have to do is decide either to recycle or composte it.
