## About Kraft-Tex

It's a very hard wearing material. It will age beautifully with wrinkles and creases but it will remain strong. It can be washedâ€”if you want to. If it gets wet, once dry it will have a softer texture. All the products I make using Kraft-Tex are hand stitched using traditional leather work techniques and using plantbased materials.

* A mixture of cellulose (over 60%), latex and colour pigments.
* It does not contain BPA or PVC.
* Not harmful to the environment or you.
* Virtually tear resistant.
* Washable.
* 100% vegan.
* Made in Germany.
* Bio-degradeable.

There are so many uses of this beautiful underrated plant-based material. If you're looking for something custom made from Kraft-Tex please contact me.
